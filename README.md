Loan Decision Model with Artificial Neural Network

Designed and implemented an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model for loan decision making using Python.

• The project involved predicting whether borrowers would default on their loans based on various financial and
credit-related features.
• Developed a binary classification model to determine loan default risk, aiding in effective risk assessment and
decision-making for lending institutions.
• Evaluated the model’s performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and confusion matrix, providing
valuable insights for assessing model effectiveness.
